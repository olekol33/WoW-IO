# WoWPy


## Background
The [World of Warcraft Avatar History Dataset](https://web.cs.wpi.edu/~claypool/mmsys-dataset/2011/wow/author.html) (WoWAH) is based on 3 years of gathering user information in World of Warcraft.  
The data is gathered in granularity of 10 minutes (we will address this unit of time as 1 virtual-time).  
  
Our project creates IO streams out of this dataset, by simulating the game and user interactions.  
  
For example, an IO request: ```A_3, 2400.0, LO_k_156_171, 0``` means that the Avatar with ID=3 asks to read the object LO_k_156_171 (the (156,171) location in Kalimdor) at time 2400.0 seconds from the start of this scene.

## Project Structure
- Modules: The runtime-representation objects of the dataset and scenes.
- Scripts: The scripts for the actions available with wow.py.
- Maps:
    - cities.csv – describes the location and type of all the cities in the world (generated by wow.py cities).
    - neighbors.txt – describes the neighbors-graph between zones in the world.
    - {continent}.csv – file for each continent that describes the zones in it (boundaries, number of cities per city-type).
    - {continent}.png  – image for each continent that represent the zones partitions map in that continent (generated by wow.py maps).
    - {continent}.pickle  – numpy representation for each continent that represents the zones partitions map in that continent (generated by wow.py maps).
- Graphs: The graphs for the scene length statistics (generated by wow.py stats) .
- Scenes: The scenes created from the dataset (generated by wow.py build).
- IOs: The output IO streams per scene (generated by wow.py run).
- environment.yml: The conda environment initialization file (for external libraries).
- wow.py: The main script.
- conf.py: The configuration file (probabilities and cities sizes).
